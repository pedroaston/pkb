## Apps

- Free apps do not add any value. Spreadsheet alternatives are better.
- Premium apps:
	1. Monarch: Really good, but only available in the US
- Summary: While there are no high value finance apps in the EU, I should start playing with some excel templates. I could revisit this topic in mid-2025.

## Brokers

- Interactive Brokers
- Xtb

I should compare both commission models, but IB is by far the most reliable one, and made for scale (millionaires) as I understood.

## Crypto Brokers

- Coinbase
- Kraken


## Crypto Wallet

- Trezor
