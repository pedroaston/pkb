This is the place where I organize my list of things TO-DO. Journeys are exploratory and focused on a learning and documentation path. Epics are a journey with a final objective in mind. An example of Journey can be a specific technology I  want to explore and document such as System programming and and Epic can be the search and acquisition of an House. Additionally I also keep a TODO list for generic tasks.
