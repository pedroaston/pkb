## Open-Source Options

- OpenWRT + mwan3: The first is a wireless router OS, and the second allows you to balance traffic to 2 WAN interfaces. Not interesting.
- Opensense: It seems to be able to run effectively. Need to investigate more.
- ZeroTier: Need to investigate
- FlexiWan: Seems working.

## Closed Alternatives
