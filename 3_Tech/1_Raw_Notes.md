- [SRv6 Network Observability (2024, Swisscom)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/119/materials/slides-119-srv6ops-swisscom-01): to be read with more attention in the future.
- [Telecom Infra Project initiative](https://telecominfraproject.com/oopt/): need to take some time to understand what is being done here, and read the article/documentation published.
- [Sonic Courses](https://route2open.com/courses/): Can do some with Ant√£o voucher. First I need to integrate a container Sonic Image to clab
