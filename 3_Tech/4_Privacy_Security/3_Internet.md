## 09/2024 Review Winner >> Firefox (custom)

This shortlist was compiled after searching for a reliable web-browser focused on privacy. At the time my go to browser was google chrome. The objective from this testing effort is to switch all of my browser on all devices to the winner. Mandatory requirements:
- App for windows, Linux and android
- Opensource

- Brave
	- Pros:
		- Integrates well with the Brave Search engine which is a best in class
	- Cons:
		- Web3 stuff and constant bloat to sell Brave products
		- Managed by Brave Software Inc
	- To Do:
		- Need to find the optimal settings
	- Why it lost: could not find a way to remove Web 3 content with ease
- LibreWolf (Disqualified by the 1st Con)
	- Pros:
		- Super clean interface
		- Private by default
		- Community-Driven
	- Cons:
		- No android app
		- Day-0 security updates come with a 2-3 day delay
	- Why it lost: not supporting android app and being behind day-0 fixes
- Firefox
	- Pros:
		- Mozilla (although is not perfect) is a non-profit organization
		- With some settings changes, and extensions it is a best in class
	- Cons:
		- not fully private by default
		- supported by Mozilla who as done some shady stuff
		- custom scripts are not clear and may introduce adicional conplexity
	- Why the winner: after changing the settings available in the settings menu, removing from the toolbar the pocket and view icons, and installing ublock ... firefox proves to be the most viable option.
